# x402 Ad Server — Build Plan

Living document. Updated at the end of every working session.

> **🚀 Resuming work from a cold start? Read this first.**
>
> 1. Read `BACKGROUND-INFORMATION.md` for the product spec (read-only reference). For commercial/stakeholder questions, see `BUSINESS-CONSTRAINTS.md`.
> 2. Scan the **Session roadmap** below — the first session without ✅ is where to pick up. Each session links to its detail file in `worklog/`; open it for the checklist, exit criteria, and findings.
> 3. Read `RUNBOOK.md` for every repeated ops task (start/stop, balance checks, funding, resets).
> 4. Confirm the user has `backend/.env` populated. The treasury vars (`TREASURY_WALLET_ID`, `TREASURY_WALLET_ADDRESS`) come from `scripts/bootstrap_treasury.py`. If they don't exist, bootstrap + fund per RUNBOOK.
> 5. Start containers: `docker compose up -d backend`. Smoke: `curl localhost:8000/health`.
> 6. The SQLite DB may be empty — that's expected. Seed with `scripts/seed_test_campaign.py` (future) or the one-liner in the relevant worklog file if you need a live campaign for testing.
> 7. Architectural decisions are fixed (see **Protocol notes** below and `memory/project_x402_adserver.md`). Don't re-litigate.
> 8. Update this file (and the matching `worklog/session-NN.md`) plus `RUNBOOK.md` at the end of every session.

**North star:** end-to-end demo loop on Solana devnet —
login → faucet → fund (x402) → bid → proof → settle → refund.

**Deadline:** 19 days to Solana Colosseum submission. Day 1 = 2026-04-21.

**Scope reminders**

- Backend: FastAPI + SQLite (Postgres later for prod).
- Frontend: React + Vite + Privy embedded wallets.
- Wallets: Privy server wallets (no Anchor, no Rust).
- Facilitator: `https://x402.org/facilitator` (no API key).
- Everything Dockerized; compose for local dev.
- Anything that does not serve the demo loop is deferred.

## Protocol notes (research findings, keep handy)

### x402 `upto` scheme — NOT usable on Solana today (verified 2026-04-21)

**Evidence (all direct file listings, not summaries):**

- Coinbase reference repo `github.com/coinbase/x402`: every `upto` path is under `evm/`:
  `contracts/evm/src/x402UptoPermit2Proxy.sol`, `go/mechanisms/evm/upto/…`,
  `typescript/packages/mechanisms/evm/src/upto/…`,
  `specs/schemes/upto/scheme_upto_evm.md`. No `upto_svm` or `svm/upto` anywhere.
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/svm/src/` has an `exact/` folder and no `upto/`.
- npm `@x402/svm@2.10.0` README line 1: _"SVM implementation of the x402 payment protocol using the **Exact** payment scheme with SPL Token transfers."_ Only `ExactSvmClient`, `ExactSvmFacilitator` are exported.
- Technical reason: `upto` on EVM uses Permit2; Solana has no Permit2 equivalent yet.

**When Solana `upto` ships, what changes in our codebase:**

Untouched (~75%): `/bid`, `/proof`, FIFO matching, OpenRTB contract, React dashboard shell, Privy auth, `used_nonces`, `settlements`, `proof_context` JWT design.

Changes (~25%, additive — our service split was built for this swap):
| Piece | Today (`exact`) | Future (`upto`) |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Campaign wallet | Privy server wallet per campaign | Not needed — funds stay in advertiser wallet |
| Funding request | 402 → full-budget USDC transfer | 402 → signed authorization (cap + expiry + nonce) |
| Per-play settlement | Privy `signAndSend` from campaign wallet | Facilitator `draw` against authorization |
| Refund endpoint | Transfer remainder back to advertiser | Delete — authorization just expires |
| `services/x402.py` | `exact` builder only | Add `upto` builder + `draw` helper |
| `models.Campaign` | `wallet_id`/`wallet_address` | Swap for `authorization_token`/`authorized_until` |

**Estimated effort when the spec+SDK are ready:** 2–3 sessions.

**Re-check trigger:** watch `github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/specs/schemes/upto/` for a `scheme_upto_svm.md` file. When it appears, re-evaluate.

## Resolved decisions (post-hackathon scope)

- **Production advertiser auth = API key (decided 2026-04-22).** Third-party ad-tech platforms cannot be forced to adopt Privy. Production `/api/campaigns*` and `/api/wallet` routes will authenticate via `X-API-Key` against a new `advertisers` table. `require_advertiser` (Privy JWT) remains for dev/demo only. Build work is tracked as mainnet blocker §7.2 in `BUSINESS-CONSTRAINTS.md`. `BACKGROUND-INFORMATION.md §Auth` says "Privy or API key" — that ambiguity is now resolved.
- **Demo-only endpoints/flags that must NOT ship to production (2026-04-22):**
  - `POST /api/campaigns/:id/simulate-play` — dashboard-only /proof driver (Session 10)
  - `AUTO_PLAY_ENABLED=true` — server-side auto-play loop (Session 11)
  - `/api/faucet` — treasury-funded USDC faucet for advertisers (Session 2)
  - `DEMO_PUBLISHER_WALLET` — hardcoded publisher address for the above
    All are currently conditionally enabled via settings but none is behind an `environment==dev` guard. **Before Session 12 deploy, wrap each in an `environment in {"dev","staging"}` check or drop from the prod router entirely.** Track as a pre-deploy checklist item.

## Must-fix before mainnet (known correctness issues accepted for the demo)

These are bugs we understand and are deferring with eyes open — at hackathon
scale (one concurrent user, few campaigns) they don't manifest. Before any
real-money deployment they MUST be fixed. Raised during a load-behavior
review 2026-04-22.

### 1. Budget overcommit at `/bid`

**Symptom:** `_pick_campaign` only requires `remaining >= cpm/1000` (budget
for one play). With a campaign whose budget covers 20 plays, N concurrent
`/bid` requests each get a valid `proof_context` JWT for the same campaign
regardless of N. We've minted N promises we can honor at most 20 of. If
publishers complete all N plays and call `/proof`, the extras get 400
`insufficient campaign budget` and write failed settlement rows. We've
effectively over-issued bid paperwork and dumped the problem on settle time.

**Fix:** reserve budget at `/bid`, release on `proof_context` TTL expiry.
Either (a) a `pending_bids` table with TTL + settlement cleanup, or
(b) a `reserved` column on `campaigns` that `/bid` atomically increments and
`/proof` decrements as it converts to `spent`. Option (b) is simpler if we
add a periodic sweep to un-reserve expired proof contexts.

### 2. Read-modify-write race on `campaigns.spent` in `execute_settlement` ✅ FIXED (Session 16.5)

**Symptom (historical):** the previous Python-side flow read `spent`, checked
the guard, mutated, committed — two concurrent `/proof` requests on the
same campaign could both pass and last-write-wins.

**Fix shipped:** atomic decrement with a guard clause, SQL-enforced. The
forward UPDATE in `app/routers/proof.execute_settlement` is now:

```sql
UPDATE campaigns
SET    spent = spent + :amount
WHERE  id = :id
  AND  budget - spent >= :amount
RETURNING spent, budget
```

Reject if `rowcount == 0`. Single statement, safe under any isolation level.
Do this BEFORE the Privy transfer, not after.

**Validated 2026-04-28:** post-reset controlled simulation ran 844 concurrent
plays distributed across 3 active campaigns with auto-play burst-firing
10–20 settlements/tick. `scripts/audit_ledger.py` returned zero DRIFT and
zero SHORT — every confirmed DB settlement matched a real on-chain transfer
to the microUSDC. Atomic UPDATE holds under burst-fire load.

### 3. Money is stored as `float`, not integer microUSDC — scheduled for Session 16.9

**Brief ready:** `worklog/session-16.9.md` has the full file-by-file plan, locked decision (string microUSDC on the wire + int micro internal), and validation criteria. Slotted before Session 17 (GCP deploy) so the Postgres migration doesn't carry float legacy.

`campaigns.budget`, `campaigns.spent`, and the Python math throughout `/bid`
`/proof` and `auto_play` all use `float`. Summing `0.001` many times drifts
on the order of `1e-16` per step, so the "final play" guard can reject a
semantically-valid play and/or leave unplayable dust in a campaign. Current
fix (2026-04-22) is `+ 1e-9` epsilon tolerance on every budget guard AND
flipping `COMPLETED` when `remaining < cost_per_play` (not `spent >= budget`).
That works for demo scale but is band-aid on top of the real issue.

**Real fix:** store money as integer microUSDC (1 USDC = 1_000_000 units) in
both the DB (`Integer` columns) and Python. No floats anywhere in the money
path. Same 6-decimal precision the SPL token mint uses on-chain, and every
comparison becomes exact integer equality. Eliminates both the
precision-rejected play and the dust-limbo-ACTIVE states without needing
tolerance at all.

### 4. Smaller things (same review)

- **No per-publisher rate limiting** on `/bid` + `/proof`. One publisher can
  DoS the ad server; mitigate with `slowapi` + Redis or at the reverse-proxy
  layer.
- **No auction between campaigns.** FIFO means one campaign takes every bid
  until drained. Production wants weighted selection (CPM, pacing, targeting).
- **Single uvicorn worker in dev**. Deploy needs `--workers N` or gunicorn;
  fix #2 above is a prerequisite since multi-worker exposes the race.
- **`used_nonces` grows forever.** Fine at demo scale. Add retention (drop
  rows older than `proof_context_ttl_seconds + grace`) as part of the
  periodic sweep.

Filed for BUSINESS-CONSTRAINTS §7 (mainnet blockers) cross-reference.

## Open decisions still to resolve

- Alembic migrations vs `create_all` — skipping Alembic until Postgres in Session 12.
- Dashboard host port — pinning to 5173 locally; revisit for deploy.
- Rate limiting on `/api/faucet` — one shot per user per hour? Decide in Session 2.
- **Decoupling campaign-api from ad-server** (raised 2026-04-21, deferred). Three options sized: Option A = shared DB + two FastAPI apps (~1 session), Option B = independent DBs + internal HTTP (~2–3 sessions, adds network hop to bid path — risky for <500ms target), Option C = event-driven (~3–5 sessions, production-grade). Leaning Option A if we decide to do it; slot between Session 7 and Session 8.
- **SOL gas subsidy model — partially resolved by Session 9 findings, still open for production** (raised 2026-04-22 Session 7, updated 2026-04-22 Session 9). **For the advertiser-funding tx specifically**: resolved — x402-solana + x402.org forces facilitator-as-fee-payer (Config 2), so the advertiser needs zero SOL. x402.org's devnet facilitator sponsors gas for free. **Still open for campaign wallet ops** (`/proof` settlements, refunds): today the treasury seeds every new campaign wallet with 0.01 SOL (~$2 on mainnet) so it can pay its own fees. After refund, unused SOL is stranded. Options unchanged: **(A)** Privy fee sponsorship via `sponsor: true` on `sign_and_send_solana`; **(B)** keep subsidy + price into CPM; **(C)** move `/proof` settlement to a facilitator-like pattern. **Also now open for production of the funding flow**: public facilitators may charge or go away, so production likely needs us to run our own facilitator (Coinbase open-sourced Go + TS impls) and pay our own gas there. Decide before Session 13 (GCP deploy).
